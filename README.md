# K.AI--Take-home
Problem statement: With the enclosed data, cluster the utterances using unsupervised learning techniques and explain the reasons for choice of algorithms you use. Assume there is noise in data. Identify important clusters and assign a suitable name to non-noise clusters.


Inference for all approaches is mentioned at the bottom of the repective ipynb files

Tf-idf
Inference:
The elbow curve tells us that the optimal number of clusters are 5,6 or 7. When we go through the word groupings we understand that the data is talking about the following queries

1.Loan requirement questions
2.Asking the bot to clear bills
3.Outstanding balance check questions
4.Money Transfer queries
5.FAQs

According to the TF-IDF word embedding technique which we just used, these five groups of data are classified in 6 clusters, since there is a significant amount of noise in the dataset and because TF-Idf is essentially a scoring algorithm which creates a score for every word based on their occurences and non occurences. The distribution of these scores, given theor weights creates a slight bias for the noisy data as well. This is vizualized in the various plots we have.

Although, the ideal number of cluster remain at 5

w2v
Inference:
The elbow curve tells us that the optimal number of clusters are 4,5. Plotting these cluster values shows us a clear distiction in the intents. Visualization from the Word2Vec model shows us how the model is more capable of differtiating between noisy data points, due to its nature of creating contexts based on their semantic meanings.

The word2vec technique combined with the TF-IDF word embedding technique, provides a clear conclusion to the number of intents and clusters we have in our data. It solidifies our understnading of the clusters(5) and their names, which are
